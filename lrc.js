[00:23]He deals the cards as a meditation
[00:29]And those he plays never suspect
[00:35]He doesn't play for the money he wins
[00:41]He doesn't play for the respect
[00:46]He deals the cards to find the answer
[00:52]The sacred geometry of chance
[00:57]The hidden law of probable outcome
[01:04]The numbers lead a dance
[01:09]I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
[01:15]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[01:20]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[01:25]But that's not the shape of my heart
[01:32]He may play the jack of diamonds
[01:38]He may lay the queen of spades
[01:43]He may conceal a king in his hand
[01:49]While the memory of it fades
[01:55]I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
[02:00]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[02:06]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[02:11]But that's not the shape of my heart
[02:17]That's not the shape the shape of my heart
[02:53]And if I told you that I loved you
[02:59]You'd maybe think there's something wrong
[03:04]I'm not a man of too many faces
[03:11]The mask I wear is one
[03:17]Those who speak know nothing
[03:22]And find out to their cost
[03:27]Like those who curse their luck in too many places
[03:34]And those who smile are lost
[03:39]I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
[03:45]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[03:50]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[03:55]But that's not the shape of my heart
[04:01]That's not the shape of my heart
[04:07]That's not the shape of my heart`;
